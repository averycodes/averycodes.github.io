A month ago I had the pleasure of handing over two of Minerva’s first diplomas to these two amazing students from Minerva’s founding class. Over the past 7 years I’ve been involved in bringing life to this endeavor from coding the initial software to living with the students in our first international campus in Berlin. I poured my heart and soul into this project and I couldn’t be prouder of the results.

Today is my last day at Minerva. My time here has been formative and I’m incredibly lucky that Ben Nelson and Jonathan Katzman took a chance on me 7 years ago. I couldn’t be more grateful to the amazing people I’ve shared this journey with. I’m going to desperately miss everyone, but I will always be a friend and cheerleader of Minerva.

After taking a bit of a summer break I’m incredibly excited to be joining the team at Virta Health working to help individuals reverse type 2 diabetes.
