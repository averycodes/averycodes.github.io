    <h2>Avery Spiel</h2>
  </div>
  <p class="left-align">I'm a seasoned, full-stack software engineer with a 15 years of experience in greenfield product development. Currently I serve and lead a team at <a href="https://www.virtahealth.com/">Virta Health</a> transforming the way diabetes healthcare is delivered. I specialize in joining early stage startups and growing engineering teams and codebases from the ground up. Trained as a mechanical engineer and self-taught as a software engineer, my  experience has focused on employing human-centered design principles to solve the worldâ€™s problems. I have put my efforts outside the office toward nurturing communities of women developers through Women Who Code, Pyladies, STEM programs for high school girls, and mentoring women making their way through coding bootcamps. I hold one of the first Bachelor of Sciences in Mechanical Engineering degrees from <a href="http://olin.edu/">Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering</a>.</p>
  <p class="left-align">In my spare time, I enjoy spending time in my garage woodshop. I ride bikes, garden, and backpack. I'm obsessed with alternative transport, community building, and the importance of the library.</p>
