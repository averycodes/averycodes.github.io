<h1>Avery Spiel</h1>
<p>I'm a software engineer at the Minerva Project- a San Francisco startup that is working to build a brand new university. I love the excitement and intensity of startups and plan to keep creating beautiful products that people love using.</p>

<p>Creating is both my passion and my purpose. I live in San Francisco. I climb rocks, ride bikes and am training for my first olympic triathlon. I'm self-reflective. I go to hackathons and I build things. I'm passionate about alternative transport, the intersection of psychology and health, and the importance of the library. I'm working to grow the community of women developers in the bay area through Women Who Code, Pyladies, and mentoring for Technovation. I enjoy everything I do.</p>
