    <h2>Avery Spiel</h2>

  <p>I'm mechanical engineer from <a href="http://olin.edu/">Olin College</a> turned software engineer for <a href="http://minerva.kgi.edu/">the Minerva Project</a> where I'm building a brand new university. I love everything about my work from being consistently challeneged intellectually, to the relationships I've built with our students, to keep creating beautiful products that people love using.</p>
  <p>Creating is both my passion and my purpose. I live in San Francisco. I ride bikes, garden, and am a member of the SF Tri Club. I go to hackathons and I build things. I'm obsessed with alternative transport, community building, and the importance of the library. I'm working to grow the community of women developers in the bay area through Women Who Code, Pyladies, and mentoring women participating in bootcamps. I enjoy everything I do.</p>
