    <h2>Avery Spiel</h2>
  </div>
  <p class="left-align">I am one of the founding members of the software engineering team at  <a href="http://minerva.kgi.edu/">Minerva</a>, a brand-new global university seeking to nurture critical wisdom for the sake of the world. I have coded and shaped every major software project bolstering the Minerva Schools from the admissions process to the proprietary online seminar classroom, to growing the team from three to twenty. Trained as a mechanical engineer and self-taught as a software engineer, my fifteen years of experience have focused on employing human-centered design principles to solve the worldâ€™s problems. I have put my efforts outside the office toward nurturing communities of women developers through Women Who Code, Pyladies, STEM programs for high school girls, and mentoring women making their way through coding bootcamps. I hold one of the first Bachelor of Sciences in Mechanical Engineering degrees from <a href="http://olin.edu/">Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering</a>.</p>
  <p class="left-align">In my spare time I enjoy spending time in my garage woodshop. I ride bikes, garden, and backpack. I'm obsessed with alternative transport, community building, and the importance of the library.</p>
