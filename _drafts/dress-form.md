I'm getting soon and I had this crazy idea that I should make my own wedding dress. Why? Probably because deep down I hate the idea of standing on stage in a shop full of white while women around me cheer and cry. Also I like sewing.

As part of this endeavor I made myself. I'd rather not try to fit the dress on my person so I made a stunt double who doesn't mind taking a pin or two. The instructions I've put together below are the results of two iterations of dress-form construction after reading through [a thorough post](https://jezebel.com/5803791/how-to-make-a-custom-dress-form-part-one) by [Jenna Sauers](https://jezebel.com/tag/jenna-sauers) and this [other also very thorough](https://modiquebychalise.blogspot.de/2012/02/my-own-custom-made-dress-form.html.) post by [Chalise](https://www.modique.com/pages/about).

I'm very pleased with the results

## Part I: Making the mold
### Supplies
Old underwear
[Plaster Bandages](http://amzn.to/2hbPDa4) (medical ones NOT craft) 30ish rolls 10m x 27 cm
Scissors 
Dremel/[Rotary Cutting Tool](http://amzn.to/2hf2clp)
Extra Dremel [cutting discs](http://amzn.to/2hnps3J)
Warm Water in a wide, shallow container
[Drop Cloth](http://amzn.to/2hbQUhu) for the floor
Vasoline
Plastic Peanuts or other cushion
Box
Sharpie
Heater

### Directions
0. Turn on heater in the space, use the toilet, put hair up, wear heels for better posture
1. Vasoline your body
Draw around your feet and find a spot to stare at
2. Cut plaster into manageable strips (12'', 9'', 6'' and 3'')
3. Dip the strips into the warm water and apply to the skin
4. Be sure to rub the plaster into the crevices of your body (spine, clavicle)
    a. Applying a lot of water and rubbing thoroughly ensures a smooth finish.
5. Apply 4 layers around the body and a 5th layer along any future seams that will be made with the dremel and around the neck (ensure the neck goes up as high as possible)
6. Allow the plaster to set but not so much that it is inflexible. You do not need to wait too long if you are using medical grade plaster (there will be a hot phase and then it will cool. After the hot phase it is fine to remove)
7. Use a sharpie to mark across the cast to make it easier to re-assemble
8. Place a tape line along where you are about to cut to protect the plaster
8. Use a dremel to cut out of the cast in the middle of the chest and the back
9. Turn the pieces outside side down onto something to cushion while it dries. Dry for at least 4-5 days. If you had to bend the plaster make sure to fix it up while it's still flexible
10. Dispose of the leftover materials and water (not in the sink!)

## Part II: Preparing the mold
### Supplies
[Plaster of Paris](http://amzn.to/2hdiq0Z)

### Directions
12. Let dry for 24 hours
13. Protect the mold with wax
14. Place the two parts of the mold together
15. Use warm water with food dye to wet more plaster bandages and apply to the cuts. Use at least 3 layers along the seam and then use additional to wrap around the mold
16. Cover the neckline and the arm holes with plastic wrap and then with plaster bandages
17. Make sure the cast is very warm

## Part III: Filling the mold
### Supplies
Polyurathane (smooth on?) 2kg version ok 6 pounds of it (f3 from brick in the yard supply?)

18. Add the hardware for the base

## Part IV: Removing the mold
### Supplies
Sandpaper
