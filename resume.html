<p class="left-align mt0 italic">August 2012 – Present</p>
<p class="left-align">Brought four major products from pre-idea to full-scale usage. Lead design sprints and blue-sky exercises before Minerva even knew what should be built. Designed and architected the original proprietary seminar classroom platform on which over 500 students spend 30+ hours per week during the school year. Designed and architected the original proprietary admissions and enrollment process through which 10,000 students apply to Minerva globally and 1-2% are accepted per year.</p>
<p class="left-align">Worked with three distinct Minerva teams to improve their internal processes, reducing unneeded hours across those teams by 20-40%. These process improvements came from automation, improved software tooling, and an application of lean manufacturing principles to understand and remove bottlenecks.</p>
<p class="left-align">Helped grow the product team from two to twenty over five years. Helped grow the Minerva team from four to 175.</p>
