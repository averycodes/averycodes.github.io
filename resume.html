<p>After attending a brand-new college, I'm now helping build a brand-new university. I'm one of the founding members of a
full-stack development team. We build the platforms supporting the students, faculty, and staff of the Minerva Schools at
 KGI. I’m interested in big problems and user-focused solutions.</p>

<h2>Minerva Project</h2>
<p>Founding Software Engineer</p>
<p>August 2012 – Present</p>
<p></p>
<p>Brought four major products from pre-idea to full-scale usage. Lead design sprints and blue-sky exercises before Minerva even knew what should be built. Designed and architected the original proprietary seminar classroom platform on which over 500 students spend 30+ hours per week during the school year. Designed and architected the original proprietary admissions and enrollment process through which 10,000 students apply to Minerva globally and 1-2% are accepted per year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Worked with three distinct Minerva teams to improve their internal processes, reducing unneeded hours across those teams by 20-40%. These process improvements came from automation, improved software tooling, and an application of lean manufacturing principles to understand and remove bottlenecks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Helped grow the product team from two to twenty over five years. Helped grow the Minerva team from four to 175.</p>
